**FumaInc** is a futuristic, terminal-based landing page designed for deploying autonomous AI agents on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the "ElizaOS" aesthetic, this project combines raw terminal interactions with modern web design principles, featuring interactive neural network animations and a brutalist UI.

## ⚡ Features

- **💻 Interactive Terminal**: A fully functional simulated CLI (Command Line Interface) that responds to user commands (`help`, `deploy`, `status`).
- **🧠 Neural Network Background**: HTML5 Canvas animation that reacts to mouse movement and click events (pulse effect), simulating a living network.
- **🎞️ Visual Pipeline**: Split-layout visualization featuring video integration to demonstrate the agent deployment process.
- **🤖 Agent Roster**: Interactive character selection grid (Genesis, Oracle, Custom) with state management.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices with a "Glassmorphism" and "Tech Brutalism" aesthetic.
